Summary: role='assistant' content="Based on the provided context, here is a summary of genes linked to Parkinson's disease (PD):\n\n1.  **Monogenic (Familial) PD:** Mutations in specific genes cause about 5-10% of PD cases.\n    *   **Autosomal Dominant (AD) Genes:** SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35.\n    *   **Autosomal Recessive (AR) Genes:** PINK1, DJ-1, Parkin.\n    *   **Rare Autosomal Recessive Gene (identified via whole-exome sequencing):** DNAJC6.\n\n2.  **Complex (Sporadic) PD:** This is the majority (over 90%) of PD cases, caused by the interaction of common genetic variants (identified through Genome-Wide Association Studies - GWAS) and environmental factors. GWAS have identified **26 risk loci**, but pinpointing the specific causal genes and variants is challenging due to weak individual effects and strong linkage disequilibrium. The context also mentions potential associations with genes like SPNS1, MLX, CNIP3, LSM7, NUCKS1, and pathways like the inositol phosphate biosynthetic pathway, although further functional validation is needed.\n\n3.  **Recent Discoveries & Candidate Genes:** Advanced methods like machine learning, transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS), and Mendelian Randomization (MR) are being used to identify potential causal genes at known GWAS loci. Some candidate genes mentioned include:\n    *   CTX1B\n    *   SCNA (likely referring to SNCA again, but also possibly other genes like SCN1B, SCN2B, etc., based on TWAS)\n    *   ARSA\n    *   INPP5F\n    *   IP6K2\n    *   ITPKB\n    *   PPIP5K2\n    *   CNIP3 (also known as CNIH3)\n    *   LSM7\n    *   NUCKS1\n\nIn summary, PD genetics involves both monogenic forms caused by mutations in specific genes (SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35, PINK1, DJ-1, Parkin, DNAJC6) and a complex, multifactorial component involving numerous common risk variants (identified at over 90 distinct genomic regions) and environmental interactions." thinking="Okay, the user is asking about genes linked to Parkinson's disease. Let me start by recalling the context provided. The context mentions several points: SNCA, LRRK2, VPS35 as autosomal dominant genes, PINK1, DJ-1, Parkin as autosomal recessive. Then there's DNAJC6 via whole-exome sequencing. The majority of cases are complex with environmental factors. GWAS identified 26 risk loci, but many are still being validated. Recent machine learning models suggested some new genes like INPP5F, IP6K2, etc.\n\nWait, the user might be a student or a researcher looking for a summary. They probably need a clear breakdown of the different types of genes involved—monogenic vs. complex. Maybe they're preparing a report or need to understand the genetic landscape for a project. The mention of new genes via machine learning could indicate interest in cutting-edge research. They might not just want the basic genes but also the latest findings. Also, the context mentions population-specific genes like PRKN in Japan, so maybe they're considering genetic diversity in studies.\n\nI should structure the answer by first explaining the monogenic forms, then the complex genetics, and touch on GWAS and new discoveries. Highlighting SNCA, LRRK2, etc., as the main ones, but also mentioning the newer genes from machine learning. The user might need to know which genes are well-established versus those still under investigation. They might also be interested in how environmental factors interact with these genes. Ensuring clarity between dominant/recessive and the complex cases is key. Avoid jargon but still precise. Maybe check if they need references or more detailed explanations, but since the query is straightforward, a concise summary should suffice.\n" images=None tool_name=None tool_calls=None

1.  **FTO (Fat Mass and Obesity Associated):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 15 (15q24)
    *   **Function:** Strongly associated with BMI (Body Mass Index). Variants near this gene influence appetite and energy expenditure. Higher BMI is a major T2D risk factor.
    *   **Example SNPs:** rs9939609, rs17815270, rs17781159

2.  **TCF7L1 (Transcription Factor 7 Like 1):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 10 (10p14)
    *   **Function:** This variant affects the function of a transcription factor involved in regulating the expression of genes important for insulin secretion in the pancreas. Variants here are strongly associated with reduced insulin secretion.
    *   **Example SNP:** rs7903198

3.  **PPARG (Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 3 (3p22.2)
    *   **Function:** This gene encodes a receptor that regulates glucose metabolism and fat storage. Variants here affect the sensitivity of fat cells (adipocytes) to insulin and the expression of genes involved in glucose transport.
    *   **Example SNPs:** rs1800889 (Pro12Ala), rs3188817

4.  **KCNJ11 (Potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 11):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 11 (11p13)
    *   **Function:** This gene encodes a subunit of the ATP-sensitive potassium channel (KATP channel) in pancreatic beta cells. This channel links ATP levels (reflecting blood glucose) to electrical activity and insulin secretion. Variants here can impair this function.
    *   **Example SNPs:** rs56082980 (His15Arg), rs1386521 (Ser23Leu)

5.  **CDKN2A (Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 9 (9p21.3)
    *   **Function:** This gene cluster is involved in regulating cell cycle and apoptosis (programmed cell death). Variants here are associated with reduced beta-cell function and increased T2D risk, potentially by affecting beta-cell replication or survival.
    *   **Example SNPs:** rs10811664, rs2305765

6.  **TCAD (Transcription Factor CCAAT/enhancer binding protein beta):**
    *   **Location:** Chromosome 15 (15q26.1)
    *   **Function:** Encodes a transcription factor crucial for adipocyte (fat cell) differentiation and function. Variants here can affect fat mass and insulin sensitivity.

10. **Other Notable Genes:** Variants have also been robustly associated with T2D risk in genes like *ALDH2*, *GLIS3*, *FTO* (already mentioned), *MC4R*, *MT-HHS* (Mitochondrial DNA), *RXRA*, *TCF7L1* (already mentioned), *WFS1*, *ZNRD1*, and many more.

**Important Considerations:**

*   **Polygenic Nature:** T2D is a polygenic disease, meaning many genes contribute, often with small individual effects.
*   **Interaction:** These genetic variants interact with environmental factors like diet, exercise, and obesity.
*   **Risk, Not Certainty:** Having these variants increases the risk of developing T2D, but it does *not* guarantee it. Conversely, not having the common risk variants does *not* mean someone is immune to T2D.
*   **Genetic Testing:** While genetic testing for T2D risk variants exists, its predictive power for developing the disease within a specific timeframe is currently limited, and ethical considerations are complex.

This list represents some of the strongest and most consistently replicated genetic associations with Type 2 Diabetes risk. Research is ongoing, and more variants are likely to be discovered.

Query: drugs targeting BRCA1 in breast cancer
PMIDs: 41193446, 41148817, 41155174, 41208884, 41207815, 41185933, 41157256, 41213388, 41158759, 41155531
Summary: Based on the provided text, here are the drugs and strategies targeting BRCA1 in breast cancer:

1.  **PARP Inhibitors (PARPi):** These drugs target the DNA repair pathway homologous recombination (HR), which is deficient in cells with BRCA1 mutations. By inhibiting PARP, they cause synthetic lethality in BRCA1-mutant cells, as these cells cannot effectively repair DNA damage (like double-strand breaks) without functional BRCA1. Examples mentioned include Olaparib, Niraparib (Niraparib is mentioned in the OlympiA trial context), Talazoparib, and earlier ones like Niraparib (though the specific name Niraparib appears twice, it's the same drug). The concept of synthetic lethality is key here.

2.  **CDK4/6 Inhibitors:** Drugs like Abemaciclib target the cell cycle machinery. The text states that Abemaciclib (and other CDK4/6 inhibitors) can be effective in BRCA1-mutant Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) cell lines, suggesting a specific efficacy in this subtype.

3.  **Immunotherapy (Combination with other modalities):** While not directly targeting BRCA1, the deficiency can sometimes be associated with immune response. The text mentions using anti-PD-1 blockade combined with radiation therapy for BRCA1-associated metastatic breast cancer (MBC), indicating a treatment strategy that leverages the tumor microenvironment potentially altered by HRD (often linked to BRCA mutations).

4.  **Combination Therapies:**
    *   **PARP Inhibitors + Proton Pump Inhibitors (PPIs):** This combination works by inhibiting FASN (via PPIs like Lansoprazole) which contributes to PARPi resistance, thereby restoring sensitivity to PARPi-induced synthetic lethality in both BRCA1-mutant and wild-type TNBC cells.
    *   **XPO1 Inhibitor (Selinexor) + Parthenolide:** This combination was computationally predicted and experimentally tested. While the primary target is XPO1 (exportin), its effects on transcription and possibly DNA repair pathways might contribute to efficacy in TNBC, including BRCA1-mutant cells.

**In summary:** The text highlights PARP inhibitors as the primary class of drugs directly leveraging the BRCA1 deficiency (synthetic lethality). CDK4/6 inhibitors show specific efficacy in BRCA1-mutant TNBC. Combinations involving PARP inhibitors (with PPIs) or other agents like Selinexor are also discussed as strategies relevant to BRCA1 status or deficiency.
